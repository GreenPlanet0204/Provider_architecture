# provider_start

A production ready flutter application template for the provider architecture.

## Inspiration

- This project is a starting point for a Flutter application using the provider architecture.
- This project heavily uses the flutter tutorials and snippets of the filled stacks YouTube channel.
- Feel free to send in Pull Requests to improve the application.

## Setup

Generate your platform specific folders with kotlin/swift

```bash
flutter create .
```

or generate your platform specific folders with objc/java

```bash
flutter create -i objc -a java .
```

Since this project uses 3 locales add this to your info.plist

```plist
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>ru</string>
    <string>en</string>
</array>
```

Generate the launcher icon (optional)

```bash
flutter pub get && pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

## Example pages included

- Main View (View that handles tab navigation)
- Splash View (Initial loading screen that uses flare animations)
- Post Details (Dynamic view that loads the post's user information)
- Settings View (Example view that launches app settings and signs out user)

## Getting started

- run `chmod +x ./format.sh && ./format.sh` to setup git pre commit formatting or
- run `chmod +x ./manual_format.sh` and run `./manual_format.sh` whenever you want to format the dart code
- run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` if you plan to add/change any serializers once
- run `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` if you plan to add/change any serializers multiple times
- Setup [derry](https://pub.dev/packages/derry) (optional) to avoid typing the above commands manually

## Adding support for another language

- Find the language local code from here [codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
- Inside of `lib/local_setup.dart` add the local code to `supportedLocalCodes`
- Add the local code to the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- Create a `<local>.json` file under assets/lang/ and fill out every value for your language
- Run `flutter clean` inside you lib apps directory if flutter complains
- There is also a different way to implement locals using the [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. An example on how to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/examples/internationalization/intl_example)

## Adding app icon

- Change icon `assets/images/logo.png` to another image
- If new icon has a different path update `flutter_icons:` in the `pubspec.yaml` file
- Run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`

## Adding another route

- create your view and view model in `lib/ui/views/<view-folder>/`
- add your view to the list of routes in `lib/ui/router.dart`
- generate the new router with

```sh
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Adding another model

### Simple model

- Create a `<YOUR_MODEL>.dart` under `core/models/<YOUR_MODEL>/<YOUR_MODEL>.dart`
- Copy the `AlertRequest` from `core/models/alert_request/alert_request.dart` and replace all the class model names with `<YOUR_MODEL>`
- Add your own custom getter values.
- Add a part file. Ex: `<YOUR_MODEL>.g.dart` above the class
- Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to build your new model

### Serializable model

- Create a `<YOUR_MODEL>.dart` under `core/models/<YOUR_MODEL>/<YOUR_MODEL>.dart`
- Copy the `User` from `core/models/user/user.dart` and replace all the class model names with `<YOUR_MODEL>`
- Add your own custom getter values.
- Add `<YOUR_MODEL>` to the list in `@SerializersFor` class constructor found under `core/models/serializer.dart`
- Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to build your new model
